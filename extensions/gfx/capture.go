// ArmCaptureCmd arms a readback of one colour target and hands back the wait.
// It is ordinary gfx API: anything holding a kernel handle may arm a capture,
// and the agent-facing capability is one caller among them.
//
// The response's channel is the only delivery path, and refusals travel it too,
// because gpu.Capture carries Err. The alternative - a channel passed in with
// the request - leaves gfx unable to refuse a second arm synchronously.

	// is refused while paused, because there would be nothing new to photograph.
